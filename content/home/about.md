# Biography

I am a first year PhD student working in the [Visual Information Processing Group](https://decsai.ugr.es/vip/index.html) of Granada University (UGR). My research line is "Video & Image Processing and Classification. Computer Vision". Specifically, my thesis topic is about probabilistic modelling for cancer detection in histopathology images which is inside of the [Enhancement, classification and interpretation of histological images of cancer (SICAP) project][1]. My thesis advisor is [Rafael Molina Soriano](https://decsai.ugr.es/~rms/).
